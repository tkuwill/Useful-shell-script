Thank you for using this shell script, in order to make this run, 
change the access permission of the shell script with "chmod +x".Then you can run the shell script by "./machowlongturnoffmusic.sh".
Then enter the secs you want, it will run. To cancel it, use "ctrl+c" to cancel it.
You can share this online of course, but remember to cite the source.
If having any problems, email me. Each of the shell scripts will have my email in. However, I am not engineer, just learning Linux.
