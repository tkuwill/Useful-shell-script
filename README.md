Here are some useful shell scripts about Linux system state created by me. Have a nice use!
You can share these online of course, but remember to cite the source.
It will increase day by day, well I hope so.
If having any problems, email me. Each of the shell scripts will have my email in. However, I am not engineer, just learning Linux.
